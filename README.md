Our Services: 
Derjani Group, a company with multi-task services in 
construction, supply, security systems fields, also entered the 
food services domain with the aim of providing diverse catering 
services in Lebanon. Owned by Mr. Roger Derjani, who 
possesses clear visions and goals of achieving high quality 
standards and results in the catering business. Derjani group sets 
its first milestone with the UN troops when opening its first 
restaurant in 2007 in the French camp 2-45 At-Tiri. 
“Derjani Resto Bar 1”, known for its continental-international 
cuisine succeeded in: - Feeding multinational contingents of the UNIFIL. - Conducting special functions with Open Buffet and live 
performances - Providing a Buffet prestige for Transfer of Authority (TOA) 
ceremonies - Providing a Special Banquet for Medal parades of different 
nationalities - Catering up to 800 meals for more than 4 different DFAC - Preparing more than 4000 take away packages for missionaries 
The diversity of DG menus and the flexibility of Derjani’s team 
in communicating with the French, Finnish, Belgian, Irish, 
Italian, and German including civilians/ Visitors of several 
nationalities of UN, ended up with highly recommendations and 
clear appreciation. 
“Le Remec”, DG’s second restaurant located in the French camp 
9-1, opened its doors in December 30 2011 to spread Derjani’s 
specialties in “plat du Jour”, salads and Pizzas among 900 
French soldiers. 
Earning the French trust and getting positive feedback from the 
French soldiers, motivated Derjani Group to open its third 
restaurant in the same camp (9-1) but with a different concept. 
“Le Chalet Montagnard”, specialized in “cheese and wine” is a 
“à la française” restaurant where Fromagerie, charcuterie, 
boulangerie are served with French wine and buffet made of 
“bouchées” and “canapés”. 
The challenge for DG behind this new concept was to succeed in 
introducing a high quality of services accompanied with an 
exceptional ambiance to the French soldiers. 
“Derjani Resto-Bar 2”: is a renovation of “Derjani Resto-Bar 
1” with same tactics and procedures. 
This premise has been redecorated to attract more clients and to 
distinguish DG restaurant from the other restaurants At- Tiri. 
“Derjani resto bar 2” considered as “the place to be” has won 
the honor of hosting the Belgian ,Finish and Irish Medal Parade 
on Feb 2nd 2013. 
“ HD Happy Diner .Restaurant and coffee shop”, located in 
Naqoura HQ is also owned by Derjani group. 
The purpose behind this profile is to highlight the flexibility and 
the openness of Derjani group in providing all its customers with 
diversity in food production, high standards in customer service 
as well as achieving DG’s main goal in creating an atmosphere 
of “feeling home, away from home” for the UN soldiers in 
Lebanon. 
Past Performance: 
The Derjani Team provides the Armed Forces with experienced 
companies that are prepared to achieve the desired results. 
History of past performance and years of quality service 
provides the Armed Forces with not only proven performance 
but also assurance that the Forces are receiving a tenured 
contractor and not one still “learning the ropes”. 
As contractor with past and current performance of services of 
various size, scope and relevance 
to the any given solicitation, coupled with the past and present 
performance of our Strategic Subcontractors we have the 
requisite history, performance background, and Corporate 
Experience and Managerial/Key personnel experience to be the 
best value contactor for the Armed Forces. 
Our proven systems of training, quality control, work 
scheduling, and personnel recruiting/retention coupled with our 
competitive pricing provides the Armed Forces with a team that 
can be counted on to do it right the first time. In our most recent 
win on an unrestricted procurement with the Armed Forces in 
Iraq and Afghanistan, Derjani Group was successful against 
such notable contractors. 
Derjani group was selected due to our quality performance, low 
price and attention to customer needs and employee training. 
This selection was truly Best Value Procurement. Some of our 
clients have provided Derjani Group with accolades on it’s Start 
Up Operations such as from US Marine Corp, Master sgt. G. 
lane says that Derjani Group Ranks a 5 on a scale of 1-5, with 5 
being Excellent Plus in our Quality Assurance, Training, and

a possible 5. Scoring was 0-5 with 0 being Unsatisfactory and 5 
being Exceptional Performance. A score of 4 was considered 
Excellent. The lowest score received on Lane evaluation was a 4 – Excellent. 
Our Strategic Partners have a long tenure of proven performance 
and adds additional depth of experience to the Derjani Team. We 
have years of experience with some of the most demanding 
contracts and security intensive locations. As an example of 
“real world” performance in action, we provided to the Air 
Force (AF), Installation Entry Control and Commercial Vehicle 
Inspection services which exceeded the high expectations of the 
AF relative to contract guard performance at the individual 
installations. These serve to illustrate that the Derjani Team can
